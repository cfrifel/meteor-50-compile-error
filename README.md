# meteor-50-compile-error
Assignment: Meteor 50 minutes

Current state of Master branch:
Just prior to importing accounts-ui and accounts-password.

Current state Compiler Error branch:
Same as master with SKYBLUE background color.

Problem description:

The error shows up after doing either "meteor reset" or "meteor add accounts-ui accounts-password"...  This problem is beyond trial and error of procedure variations, maybe i should just try and resinstall meteor.
