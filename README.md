# meteor-50-compile-error
Assignment: Meteor 50 minutes

Current state of this code:
Just prior to importing accounts-ui and accounts-password.

Problem description:
The next step in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSFH1T3SnBY&t=1695s">video</a>  is to import accounts-ui and accounts-password by typing "meteor add accounts-ui accounts-password".  Doing this step creates a compiler error when trying to run the meteor app.  The code in tasklist.js is unchanged before/after this step and is the source of the compiler error.
