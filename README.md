# meteor-50-compile-error
Assignment: Meteor 50 minutes

Current state of Master branch:
Just prior to importing accounts-ui and accounts-password.

Current state Compiler Error branch:
Same as master with SKYBLUE background color.

Problem description:
The next step in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSFH1T3SnBY&t=1695s">Meteor in 50 minutes</a>  is to import accounts-ui and accounts-password by typing "meteor add accounts-ui accounts-password" into the command prompt.  Doing this step creates a compiler error when trying to run the meteor app.  Tasklist.js is unchanged before/after this step and is the source of the compiler error.
